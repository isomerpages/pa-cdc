<p>Created in commemoration of Singapore’s 60th anniversary, Finding Oneself
in Another is a diptych mosaic artwork co-created by clients from Bethesda
Care Centre’s FAME Club, many of whom live with schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and depression. The process of making this piece became a journey
of shared expression, courage, and healing.
<br>
<br>The first panel depicts a radiant cluster of Vanda Miss Joaquim orchids—Singapore’s
resilient national flower. Each bloom represents a unique voice in our
community, yet together they form a vibrant whole. The second panel begins
with a humble seed nestled at the centre of a spiral shell. From this seed,
a tender orchid stalk emerges and unfurls—symbolising the growth of identity
through the layers of self-discovery and shared experience.
<br>
<br>During the time spent creating the artwork, many conversations explored
what it means to be Singaporean, and what it’s like to live with and journey
through mental health struggles in this country. Clients often spoke of
FAME Club as a special and safe space—one that brought joy, connection,
and a sense of belonging. Within the group, each person naturally gravitated
toward different roles: some led, others assisted, encouraged, or supported.
Together, they collaborated in choosing colours, laying tiles, grouting,
and cleaning the final piece. The process became not only a form of artistic
creation, but a powerful expression of care, solidarity, and mutual respect.</p>
