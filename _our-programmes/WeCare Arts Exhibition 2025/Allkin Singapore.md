<p><strong>One HeArt One Home SG 60 - Festival Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>One Heart One Home" is a community art initiative designed to engage seniors
in creative expression while promoting social connection, cultural appreciation,
and overall well-being. Conducted with participants from Blk 420, the program
offered a vibrant and inclusive space where seniors explored various traditional
art forms such as Batik, Rangoli, Henna Art, Peranakan Art, Chinese painting,
calligraphy, and Zentangle.
<br>
<br>The initiative not only provided a platform for self-expression but also
promoted cognitive stimulation, emotional well-being, and gentle physical
activity. By encouraging storytelling and cultural sharing, "One Heart
One Home" fostered a sense of belonging, purpose, and joy—leaving behind
both beautiful artwork and heartfelt memories.</p>
<p><strong>SG60 – Festival Celebrations</strong>
<br>
<br>Around 25 enthusiastic participants came together to collaboratively create
six large 50x50 cm canvases themed around SG60 – Festival Celebrations.
Each canvas beautifully represented one of Singapore’s key festivals—Chinese
New Year, Hari Raya, National Day, Vesak Day, Deepavali, and Christmas.</p>
