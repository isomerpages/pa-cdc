<p><strong>Project Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>Batik is a meaningful representation of Singapore’s multicultural identity
and plays a valuable role in the theme "Our Community – SG60 &amp; Beyond."
Traditionally rooted in Malay and Indonesian culture, batik reflects the
heritage of the Malay community and Singapore’s close ties with the region.
By celebrating batik, we honour the cultural traditions that have shaped
our nation’s identity over the past 60 years.</p>
<p>Batik also symbolizes unity in diversity—its many patterns and colours
mirror the different races and cultures in Singapore living harmoniously
together. In recent years, batik has evolved beyond traditional uses and
is now seen in modern fashion and art, showing how tradition and innovation
can go hand in hand. This reflects Singapore’s journey: respecting the
past while embracing change.</p>
<p>Promoting batik in schools and communities fosters appreciation for local
crafts and encourages shared creativity, patience, and pride—values essential
to building a strong and connected community. As we look beyond SG60, batik
serves as a reminder that our cultural roots remain important in shaping
our future. By keeping traditions like batik alive, we ensure that our
community continues to grow with a strong sense of identity, unity, and
purpose.</p>
