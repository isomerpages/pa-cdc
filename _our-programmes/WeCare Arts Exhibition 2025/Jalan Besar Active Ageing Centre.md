<p><strong>Project Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>Hands of the Nation: A Ceramic Celebration of SG60” is a heartfelt tribute
to Singapore’s rich and diverse heritage, expressed through ceramic tiles
hand-crafted by seniors born across five decades — the 1920s to 1960s.
Representing all three major ethnic groups — Chinese, Malay, and Indian
— these seniors are the very hands that helped build our nation.</p>
<p>The project brings together pioneers from all walks of life: retired teachers,
cleaners, business owners, housewives, and more. Some are living with conditions
such as dementia, stroke, or chronic illnesses, while others are wheelchair
users. Despite their differences, they found common ground in community
and creativity. Through clay, they have shared personal stories, cultural
memories, and hopes for the future, capturing the essence of SG60 and what
lies beyond.</p>
