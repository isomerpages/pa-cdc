<p>Title: Weaving Dreams, Crafting Ways</p>
<p></p>
<p>Project description</p>
<p>This tapestry is a celebration of diversity. The weave of random colours
and textures shows how differences can co-exist harmoniously once we learn
to embrace and appreciate the beauty of diversity.</p>
<p>A story of strength, struggles and small victories. The colourful threads
also represent the creative ways the mother is helping her child develop.
Silent strength of special bond. Mother and child's love. Beyond boundaries.</p>
