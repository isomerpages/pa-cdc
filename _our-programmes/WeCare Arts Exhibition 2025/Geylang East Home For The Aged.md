<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>
</p>
<p>This collaborative artwork expresses the heartfelt hopes of our seniors
for the Singapore of tomorrow; one that is deeply connected to nature and
guided by the enduring values of love, peace, and compassion. Through their
creative expressions, the seniors offer a vision of a future where urban
life and the natural world exist in harmony, and where human relationships
are shaped by care, understanding, and empathy.</p>
<p>Many of the artworks feature birds, dogs, squirrels, and other animals,
reflecting the seniors’ affection for wildlife and their wish for a city
that protects and celebrates nature. Gardens, trees, and imaginative landscapes
appear throughout the piece, symbolizing their dream of a greener Singapore;
one where people find joy, healing, and connection in everyday encounters
with nature.</p>
<p>Beyond the environment, their contributions speak to deeper social values:
a longing for a peaceful and inclusive society, where freedom is cherished,
and every generation feels supported and safe. The artwork becomes more
than just a visual display; it is a heartfelt message to future generations
about the kind of Singapore they hope to build together.</p>
<p>Aligned with the SG60 theme “Our Community: SG60 and Beyond”, this piece
affirms that love, compassion, and unity must be at the heart of Singapore’s
continued journey.</p>
