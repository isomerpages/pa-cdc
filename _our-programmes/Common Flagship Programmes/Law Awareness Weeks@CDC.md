LAW@CDC first started in providing basic legal education to residents through legal talks held at Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) and Residentsâ€™ Committee (RC) Centres in the five districts. These talks are tailored for those without legal training by simplifying legal jargon for easy comprehension.

Additionally, there are two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) collaborations. One is between the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS), now known as Pro Bono Singapore (PBSG) to establish a Community Legal Pro Bono Services Network (Community Legal Clinics). 

The other MOU involves CDCs, LSPBS, three Institutes of Higher Learning (National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, and Singapore University of Social Sciences) and the Singapore Counsel Association (SCCA), on Law Awareness Weeks@CDC.
