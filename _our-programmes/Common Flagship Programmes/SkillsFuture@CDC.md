The SkillsFuture Festival@CDC is designed to reach out to the community and provide residents with a convenient and comprehensive platform for skills and job resources. This initiative aims to provide residents with access to these resources anytime and anywhere.

Through the programme, the CDCs offer virtual workshops and talks that cover a range of topics related to employability skills and lifelong learning.Â  In addition, industry experts participate in Facebook live chats to discuss current job trends and skills that will be essential in the future.
