<h3>About ArtsEverywhere @ CDC</h3>
<p>ArtsEverywhere @ CDC brings arts experiences to communities where they live,work
and play. Every month, members of the public can look forward to art performances,
workshops and activities around Singapore, and develop a greater appreciation
for the arts through these shared experiences. This initiative is in line
with our aspiration for <em>Our SG Arts Plan (2023 - 2027)</em> to build <em>A Connected Society</em>,
where our social connections and national identity are strengthened through
the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ArtsEverywhere @ CDC is a collaboration between the National Arts Council, People's
Association,&nbsp;and the five Community Development Councils, and is supported
by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.</p>
