</p><p>The SG60 Vouchers will be disbursed across the month of July. SC seniors will be able to claim the vouchers first from 1 July, followed by eligible adults from 22 July. The SG60 Vouchers will expire on 31 December 2026.

</p><p>In terms of claiming and spending, the SG60 Vouchers will have the same user experience as the Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers:

</p><ul><li>Claim: The SG60 Vouchers can be claimed digitally on RedeemSG via Singpass. SCs who are unable to claim their vouchers digitally can approach their nearest Community Centres/Clubs (CCs) for assistance to claim the vouchers.</li>
<li>Spend: The SG60 Vouchers can be used at all businesses that accept the CDC Vouchers. Half of the SG60 Vouchers will be allocated for spending at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, while the other half will be allocated for spending at participating supermarkets.</li></ul>
<p>The SG60 Vouchers will benefit about three million SC adults.
