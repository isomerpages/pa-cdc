<h3>About ArtsEverywhere@CDC</h3>
<p>ArtsEverywhere@CDC brings arts experiences to communities where they live,
work and play. Every month, members of the public can look forward to arts
performances, workshops and activities around Singapore, and develop a
greater appreciation for the arts through these shared experiences. This
initiative is in line with our aspiration for <em>Our SG Arts Plan (2023 - 2027)</em> to
build <em>A Connected Society</em>, where our social connections and national
identity are strengthened through the arts.</p>
<p>ArtsEverywhere@CDC is a collaboration between the National Arts Council,
People's Association,&nbsp;and the five Community Development Councils,
and is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, with <em>Catch</em> (catch.sg)
as the official arts and culture media partner.</p>
