On 12 September 2014, the Office of the Mayors and the Law Society of Singapore, now called Pro Bono Singapore (PBSG), signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish the Community Legal Pro Bono Services Network. The purpose of this network is to provide legal advice and information to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, who are in need of assistance.

Currently, there are a total of 21 Community Legal Clinics (CLCs) that have been established at Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Community Centres/Residents' Committee (CCs/RCs) across 5 districts.

To book a consultation with a qualified lawyer, an appointment must be made in advance. The consultation usually lasts for 20 minutes and is free of charge. It is important to note that the pro bono lawyers are not able to represent individuals in court.

To make an appointment at any of the CLCs located in the Central Singapore, North East, North West, South East, and South West districts, you may contact +65 6536 0650 or send an email to [help@probono.sg](mailto:help@probono.sg). Presently, the CLC at North East is currently offering virtual consultations via Zoom.

If you need to reschedule your appointment, you must inform the service officer at least 3 working days prior to the appointment date. If you miss the appointment without giving prior notice, the discretion to re-register for another appointment lies with Pro Bono Singapore.
