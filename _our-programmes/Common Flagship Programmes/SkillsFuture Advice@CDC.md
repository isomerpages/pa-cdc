In 2017, the SkillsFuture Advice (SFA) programme was launched in Singapore to help Singaporeans with skills upgrading and career planning.&nbsp;&nbsp; This program has since signed two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Community Development Councils (CDCs), SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), and Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to strengthen their commitment to upgrading the national workforce.

Under the SFA program, job fairs, career planning workshops, and industry-specific workshops had been organised to assist residents in navigating the SkillsFuture landscape, identifying their strengths, and becoming more knowledgeable about the current and future job market's required skill sets.
