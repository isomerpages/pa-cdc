![SME Centres at CDC](/images/Common%20Flagship%20Progs/SME%20CENTRES%20CDC.png)The SME Centres@CDC were established in 2013 to provide heartland Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) with greater convenience and access to business resources and advice. Leveraging on existing grassroots networks to identify business needs, SME Centres work with the CDCs and Trade Associations and Chambers to address issues faced by SMEs in specific trades or locations.  
  
As the first point of help for SMEs, the SME Centres@CDC provide local businesses with integrated services including business and productivity diagnosis, guidance on the government assistance schemes and capability workshops.
