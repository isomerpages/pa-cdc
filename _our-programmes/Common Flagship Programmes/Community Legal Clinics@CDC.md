The Office of the Mayors and the Law Society of Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 12 September 2014 to launch the Community Legal Pro Bono Services Network to assist needy Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who are seeking legal advice and information.  
  
To-date, 15 CLCs have been set up at the CDCs and the CCs/RC.  
  
An appointment is required before the consultation, which is typically a 20 minutes one-to-one consultation with a qualified lawyer. Registered residents are required to bring along their identity card and related documents. Consultation is free.  
  
<i>*Do note that the pro bono lawyers cannot represent you in court.  </i>
