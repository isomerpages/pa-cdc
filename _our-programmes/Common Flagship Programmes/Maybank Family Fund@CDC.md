Launched in November 2018, the $1.55 million Maybank Family Fund@CDC aims to uplift low income and vulnerable families through three broad areas of financial empowerment, livelihood and employability.  
  
The fund includes a five-year insurance coverage scheme by Maybank to provide medical and mobility expenses reimbursement for up to 1,000 needy families.
