<p>SkillsFuture @ CDC aims to help the community to be more aware of the
opportunities in the growth economies and take charge of their learning
to navigate the future employment landscape through 5 district-level festivals.
The festivals shine a spotlight on three highly sought-after industries
of the future â€“ Care, Digital and Green.</p>
<p>These learning festivals will be filled with workshops, seminars and live
demonstrations to enable residents to have greater access to learning opportunities
and resources to stay relevant and lead an enriching life.</p>
