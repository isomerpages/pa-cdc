<h4>About WeCare Arts Experiences</h4>
<p>WeCare Arts Experiences is a collaboration between the National Arts Council
(NAC), the People’s Association (PA) and the five Community Development
Councils (CDCs). It encourages beneficiaries of Social Service Agencies
(SSAs) and Community Development Councils (CDCs), as well as community
partners, such as Grassroots Organisations (GROs) and Self-Help Groups
(SHGs), to access arts and cultural experiences by Singapore’s cultural
institutions, national arts companies, programmes listed under the SG Culture
Pass, and signature programmes (e.g. ArtsEverywhere @ CDC).</p>
<p>Through these experiences, beneficiaries can bond over a shared arts experience
with immediate family members, caregivers or befrienders and strengthen
social ties.</p>
