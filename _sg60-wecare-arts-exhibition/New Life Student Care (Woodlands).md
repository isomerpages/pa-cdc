<p>Mixed media installation</p>
<p>154 × 192 × 64 cm</p>
<p>Collection of New Life Community Services - New Life Student Care (Woodlands)</p>
<p>Singapore’s blueprint for a carbon-free future is embodied in the Green
Plan 2030, with its vision of achieving net-zero emissions by the middle
of the 21st century. In this collaborative two-part art installation, students
reimagined Singapore’s tomorrow by transforming recycled materials into
depictions of nature and our future urban landscapes.</p>
<p>The wall piece features a magnifying glass motif that reveals Singapore
as a thriving ant colony—each ant symbolises a Singaporean contributing
through hard work and care. This imagery invites reflection on how even
the smallest ideas can transform into reality.</p>
<p>At the heart of the installation, the sculptural work conveys students’
hopes for a city where creativity, sustainability and nature flourish together.
Using recycled textures, it envisions a skyline intertwined with organic
elements, representing both environmental stewardship and the pursuit of
sustainable innovation.</p>
