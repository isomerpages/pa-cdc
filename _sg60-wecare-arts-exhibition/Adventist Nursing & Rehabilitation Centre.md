<p>2025</p>
<p>Canvas tote bags</p>
<p>37.5 × 35 cm</p>
<p>Collection of Adventist Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre</p>
<p>In celebration of SG60, the tote bags that make up <em>Ageless Colourful Life—SG60</em> are
bursting with vibrant colours, cherished local icons and heartfelt memories.
A tribute to pride, unity and care, it inspires us to look ahead with hope
together. Each brushstroke brings to life familiar symbols, from <em>kopi</em> and <em>kueh</em> to
the Vanda Miss Joaquim and Gardens by the Bay, evoking warmth, connection
and the joy of shared moments. Filled with dynamic hues and meaningful
imagery, this artwork reminds us that life is colourful and meaningful
at every age.</p>
