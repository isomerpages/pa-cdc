<p><strong><em>Dreaming On: SG60 Through Seasoned Eyes</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Acrylic on canvas
<br>120 × 120 cm
<br>Collection of Neighbour Ring Community Services</p>
<p><em>Dreaming On </em>features the voices of our seniors as they imagine
Singapore’s future through art and storytelling. Part of a larger multimedia
installation, the current display showcases nine paintings taken from the
original artwork. Each canvas is inspired by themes drawn from both the
natural and urban environments—featuring places, memories and aspirations.</p>
<p>Collectively, the artwork highlights familiar subjects such as traditional
games like kiting and <em>sepak takraw</em> (or foot volleyball), as well
as local otters, all easily recognisable to Singaporeans. At its heart, <em>Dreaming On</em> celebrates
the everyday elements, shared experiences and cherished icons that make
us distinctively Singaporean.</p>
