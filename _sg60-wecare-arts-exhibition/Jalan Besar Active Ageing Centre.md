<p><strong><em>Hands of the Nation: A Ceramic Celebration of SG60</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Ceramic tiles
<br>55 × 20 cm
<br>Collection of Jalan Besar Active Ageing Centre</p>
<p><em>Hands of the Nation: A Ceramic Celebration of SG60</em> honours Singapore’s
rich and diverse heritage through handcrafted ceramic tiles made by seniors
born between the 1920s and 1960s. Representing the Chinese, Malay and Indian
communities, these seniors are the very hands that helped build our nation.</p>
<p>This project brings together pioneers from all walks of life, from retired
teachers, cleaners, business owners, housewives and more to celebrate their
shared creativity and strong community spirit. Some artists face challenges
such as dementia, stroke, chronic illnesses or mobility issues. Yet, they
are able to use clay to express personal stories, cultural memories and
hopes for the future, capturing the enduring spirit of SG60 and beyond.</p>
