<p><strong><em>Strings of Unity</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Mixed Media
<br>92 × 92cm
<br>Collection of Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Eurasian
Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and
Yayasan MENDAKI</p>
<p><em>Strings of Unity</em> is a string art installation created by children
from four Self-Help Groups (SHGs) representing Singapore’s different ethnic
communities. This artwork symbolises the importance of bridging communities
across diverse groups. The tree’s roots represent Singapore’s strong foundation,
while its vibrant leaves reflect the many races and cultures that make
up the nation—growing together in mutual support.</p>
<p>Through the collaborative process of making this artwork, children from
the various Self-Help groups worked together—forming friendships, building
bonds, and learning the value of teamwork. Each string they placed is a
thread of shared purpose, weaving a collective story of unity, hope, and
belonging as we look towards Singapore’s future.</p>
