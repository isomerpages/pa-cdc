<p><strong><em>Singapore as a Food Paradise for SG60</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Collage and crayon on paper
<br>30 × 42cm
<br>Collection of Pasir Panjang Hill Community Services Centre</p>
<p><em>Singapore as a Food Paradise for SG60 </em>recognises the vital role
food plays in bringing together Singapore’s diverse communities. A key
inspiration for this work is the nation’s hawker heritage. It was officially
recognised by UNESCO in December 2020 as an Intangible Cultural Heritage
of Humanity—highlighting its cultural and social significance.</p>
<p>The artwork celebrates Singapore’s rich culinary heritage, where evolving
food traditions continue to unite and inspire generations to come. Featuring
some of Singapore’s favourite local dishes such as chilli crab, curry puff
and traditional desserts, this series of paintings reflects the ongoing
journey of a nation nourished by its cultural legacy and hope.</p>
