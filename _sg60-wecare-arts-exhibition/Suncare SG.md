<p><strong><em>Skyline of Tomorrow</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2025</p>
<p>Mixed media installation</p>
<p>180 × 100 × 100 cm</p>
<p>Collection of Suncare SG</p>
<p><em>Skyline of Tomorrow</em> envisions the future landscape of Singapore
through a collaborative sculpture that captures children’s hopes. This
model reflects a shared dream of innovative architecture and welcoming
neighborhoods. Crafted from recycled materials such as cardboard, each
child contributed imaginative designs for houses that form an urban landscape
inspired by sustainability.</p>
<p>This artwork represents their hope for an inclusive society that embraces
everyone and their aspirations. Within the landscape, several paper houses
represent places children love and dream about—candy shops, arcades and
more—adding playful and personal touches to the artwork. <em>Skyline of Tomorrow </em>serves
as a reminder that a peaceful future is built by those who have the courage
to envision a world where everyone can thrive together.</p>
