<br>2025
<br>Mixed media on canvas
<br>100 × 55 cm
<br>Collection of Geylang East Home for the Aged</p>
<p>This collaborative artwork beautifully captures the heartfelt hopes of
our seniors for Singapore’s future—a city where nature and urban life thrive
in harmony. Tiny natural landscapes dot the canvas, depicting scenes of
idyllic gardens, serene lakes, small houses and diverse flora.</p>
<p>These delicate details come together to symbolise the community’s shared
dream of a greener Singapore where people of all ages can find joy, healing
and meaningful connection through everyday encounters with nature. Through
this artwork, the seniors express their vision of a sustainable, nurturing
environment that embraces both progress and the preservation of natural
beauty.</p>
