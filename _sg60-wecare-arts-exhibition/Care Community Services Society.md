<p><strong><em>SG60 Through Our Eyes</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Mixed media on canvas
<br>122 × 295 cm
<br>Collection of Care Community Services Society</p>
<p><em>SG60 Through Our Eyes</em> celebrates connection across generations,
the richness of our diverse experiences and what it means to grow up in
Singapore. This intergenerational art project brought together children,
youth and seniors from the MacPherson community to co-create a visual composition
celebrating Singapore’s journey as a nation and commemorating our 60th
anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>Each of the 30 small canvases features a collage of photographs, written
messages and gathered keepsakes such as cassette tapes. Every element was
carefully chosen by the creators to express their personal identity—ranging
from the seniors’ fond reflections of the past to the children’s and youths’
vibrant depictions of their hobbies and aspirations.</p>
<p>Together, the artworks form a tapestry of past stories that shaped Singapore,
the present that continues to unfold, and the hopes of a generation still
to come—offering a vivid portrait of the essence of our shared Singapore
identity.</p>
