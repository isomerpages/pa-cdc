<p><strong><em>My Home, My Hope</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2025</p>
<p>Mixed media installation</p>
<p>110 × 110 × 110 cm</p>
<p>Collection of The Salvation Army William Booth Corps Student Care Centre</p>
<p>This vibrant installation features a pot as its central element. Inside,
various types of food represent the nation’s rich and diverse ethnic heritage.
The pot rests on a foundation of rocks that embody Singapore’s shared values—Boldness,
Resilience, Openness and Multiculturalism. Surrounding it are four children
from different ethnic groups, each holding tools that reflect their career
aspirations.</p>
<p>On the surface of the pot, the landscape of Singapore unfolds—from traditional
attap houses to contemporary Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) flats—interspersed
with imaginative future dwellings. A rainbow handle arches overhead, symbolising
the hopes and dreams of people, and is inscribed with the children’s heartfelt
messages for Singapore’s enduring harmony.</p>
