<p><em>Batikscape: The Art of Our Community</em> celebrates batik as a vibrant
symbol of Singapore’s multicultural identity. This artwork honours batik’s
role in fostering unity through diversity, with its intricate patterns
and colours reflecting the harmonious way Singapore’s many cultures coexist.
Batik has evolved from a traditional craft to contemporary art and fashion,
and is a prime example of how Singapore’s heritage has continued to endure.
Looking beyond SG60, <em>Batikscape</em> reminds us that preserving cultural
roots is essential to building a unified and purposeful future.</p>
