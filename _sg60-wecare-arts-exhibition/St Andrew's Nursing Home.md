<p><strong><em>Canvas of Dreams - Celebrating SG60 And Hopes For Singapore’s Future</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2025</p>
<p>Acrylic on canvas</p>
<p>300 × 200 cm</p>
<p>Collection of St. Andrew’s Nursing Home (Aljunied), St. Andrew’s Nursing
Home (Buangkok), St. Andrew’s Nursing Home (Henderson), St. Andrew’s Nursing
Home (Queenstown), St. Andrew’s Nursing Home (Taman Jurong), St. Andrew’s
Nursing Home (Tampines North) and St. John’s - St. Margaret’s Nursing Home</p>
<p>Residents from seven St. Andrew’s Nursing Homes came together to share
their creativity in this artwork. As part of the production process, the
residents explored various paint application techniques to create a patterned
background. Inspired by Singapore’s 60th anniversary, the canvas features
a palette of red, white, silver and gold, symbolising courage, peace, wisdom
and hope.</p>
<p>The pictorial elements are based on individual drawings contributed by
the residents, with their creative expressions rendered within this unified
mural. Throughout the canvas, shapes such as the crescent moon and stars
from the Singapore flag appear alongside motifs drawn from nature and symbols
of peace and love.</p>
