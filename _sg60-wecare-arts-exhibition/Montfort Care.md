<p><strong><em>Handmade Histories : Honouring The Past</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Ceramic
<br>70 × 77 × 25 cm
<br>Collection of Montfort Care (Goodlife Makan)</p>
<p><em>Handmade Histories : Honouring The Past</em> honours <em>samsui </em>women—icons
of strength and pioneers in shaping Singapore’s early urban landscape.
These Chinese immigrants arrived in Singapore in the early 20th century
and took on tough construction and manual labour roles in our society.</p>
<p>Although their profession had faded away by the 1980s, their legacy remains
a symbol of resilience and dedication. In this work, each figure is hand-shaped
by a community artist and is depicted wearing the <em>samsui</em> women’s
signature red headpiece, a symbol of their professional identity. Accompanying
the figures are miniature models of local favourites like kaya toast, soft-boiled
eggs and <em>kopi</em>—symbols of comfort, heritage and community life.</p>
