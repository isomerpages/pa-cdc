<p>Collection of Be Kind SG</p>
<p>Through the act of weaving, individual threads gain strength and beauty
as they come together to form a tapestry. <em>Weaving Dreams, Crafting Ways</em> is
a visual testament to how our stories can blend harmoniously within a single
frame, even though we are all individuals with unique perspectives. This
multimedia installation brings together six distinct artworks created by
youths and caregivers, each contributing their personal experiences and
creative expressions.</p>
<p>United into one cohesive piece, the work celebrates collaboration and
shared meaning. Its vibrant interplay of colours and textures symbolises
the richness of diversity and the strength of community created through
collective storytelling.</p>
