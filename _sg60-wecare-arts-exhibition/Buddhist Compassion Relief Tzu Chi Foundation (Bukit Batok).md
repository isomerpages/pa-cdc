<p><strong><em>SG60: Beauty of Singapore</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Paint and paper collage on canvas
<br>150 × 200 cm
<br>Collections of Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu-Chi Foundation (Bukit Batok)</p>
<p>Created in celebration of Singapore’s 60th year of independence, <em>SG60: Beauty of Singapore</em> is
a collaborative collage project led by seniors from diverse backgrounds.
Through the layering of images, textures and personal symbols, the artwork
explores themes of resilience, cultural diversity and shared identity.</p>
<p>Central to this work is the theme of care in all its forms: physical,
emotional, financial and mental. Each piece of the collage represents how
our seniors continue to contribute meaningfully to society, drawing strength
from their experiences and communities.</p>
<p>Beyond the art-making process, this project fosters social connection
and mutual respect, offering a space for seniors to bond, share stories
and celebrate the multicultural spirit that defines Singapore.</p>
