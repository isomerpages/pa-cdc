<p><strong><em>Clay Modelling on Canvas Panel</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2025</p>
<p>Clay on canvas</p>
<p>42 × 59 × 10 cm</p>
<p>Collection of Tsao Foundation</p>
<p><em>Clay Modelling on Canvas Panel</em> features a detailed map of Singapore
that highlights the city’s various modes of transport—buses, MRT, and aeroplanes—and
illustrates the evolution of Singapore’s vibrant transit system. Created
by seniors from Tsao Foundation, the work emphasises the comfort and convenience
of our public transport system, especially valued for its accessibility
when seniors need to attend their medical appointments.</p>
<p>Through this heartfelt creation, the artists express a hopeful vision
for the future where public transport becomes even more accessible and
welcoming, helping everyone move forward with greater ease and care.</p>
