<p><strong><em>Threads of Harmony: Our SG60 Mosaic of Dreams</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2025</p>
<p>Mosaic on board</p>
<p>101 × 111 cm</p>
<p>Collection of New Life Community Services - New Life Student Care (Jelapang)</p>
<p>In this work, students explore mosaic making as an expressive art technique
by using symbols of unity and cultural pride. The piece highlights Singapore’s
richness and evolving identity, shaped by heritage and sustainability.
The design draws inspiration from contributions that define Singapore’s
spirit, expressing our nation’s journey—past, present and future—towards
a cultural legacy that endures.</p>
<p>Assembled by young hands, the mosaic is both meticulous and collaborative.
It reflects the belief that every person, culture and memory adds to the
larger picture of Singapore’s identity, in a society where tradition and
innovation coexist in harmony. Each fragment—chosen for its colour, shape
and texture—builds layers of meaning and visual balance.</p>
<p>This hands-on process requires patience and teamwork, as individual parts
merge into a vibrant, cohesive whole. It stands as a metaphor for community
and connection, showing how diverse elements unite to create something
greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
