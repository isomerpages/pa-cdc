<p>The Lions Befrienders’ <em>Senior Dance Programme</em> is a 10-week initiative
designed to help seniors age confidently, actively and meaningfully. Focusing
on street dance, particularly hip hop, the programme promotes holistic
well-being by encouraging movement, fostering social connection and celebrating
self-expression. Seniors learn choreography at a comfortable pace and work
towards performing to the song “Shine Your Light” in celebration of Singapore’s
National Day and reaching the SG60 milestone.</p>
