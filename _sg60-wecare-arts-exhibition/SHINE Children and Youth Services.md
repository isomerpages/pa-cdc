<p><em>STAR Dance Crew</em> harnesses the power of dance to uplift and empower
young individuals. Through movement, children convey their stories, emotions
and dreamsâ€”building confidence in self-expression. The dance programme
nurtures creativity and provides a safe, supportive space for personal
growth and social bonding. Here, dance becomes a language of hope and strength,
helping participants overcome challenges and celebrate their creative identities.</p>
