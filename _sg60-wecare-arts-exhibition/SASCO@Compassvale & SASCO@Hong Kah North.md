<p><strong><em>Timeless Hopes, Endless Dreams</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Mixed media installation
<br>180 × 120 × 20 cm
<br>Collection of SASCO@Compassvale &amp; SASCO@Hong Kah North</p>
<p>For the work <em>Timeless Hopes, Endless Dreams</em>, seniors from SASCO
Active Ageing Centre and Daycare Centre were invited to reflect on the
past, connect with heritage that holds personal meaning to them, and imagine
the future. This artwork stands both as a tribute to their lived experience
and a celebration of continued creativity in the later part of life.</p>
<p>While creating this artwork, the seniors explored digital photography
and online media as creative tools for expression, capturing subjects and
scenes drawn from their daily lives and memories. This artwork also features
iconic landmarks such as the former National Theatre at Fort Canning and
other significant buildings in their lives, offering a glimpse into spaces
tied to memory and identity.</p>
