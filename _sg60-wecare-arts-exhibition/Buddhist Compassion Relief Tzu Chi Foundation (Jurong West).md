<p><em>SG60: Forward with Fortitude</em> is a collaborative collage created
by seniors to commemorate Singapore’s 60th year of independence. Containing
personal stories and shared memories, the artwork reflects the nation's
transformation from the 1960s to the present day.</p>
<p>Crafted using recycled materials, the mural incorporates iconic scenes
and landmarks such as HDB blocks, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore
River, symbolising our progress in heritage, architecture and sustainability.
These familiar scenes celebrate Singapore’s growth while honouring the
resilience, unity and multicultural identity of its people.</p>
<p>This community art project empowers seniors to explore creativity beyond
age, build connections, and take pride in shaping a shared narrative of
Singapore’s journey, past, present and future.</p>
