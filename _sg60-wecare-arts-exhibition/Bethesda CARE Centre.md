<p><strong><em>Finding Oneself in Another, from Seed to Bloom</em></strong>
<br>2025
<br>Mosaic on board
<br>60 × 60 cm
<br>Collection of Bethesda CARE Centre</p>
<p><em>Finding Oneself in Another, from Seed to Bloom</em> is a diptych mosaic
created by members of Bethesda Care Centre’s FAME Club, many of whom live
with mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
depression. The artwork traces a collective journey of self-discovery,
healing and connection.</p>
<p>In this work, the first panel depicts growth from a young seedling, symbolising
the unfolding of identity. The other panel features Singapore’s national
flower— the Vanda Miss Joaquim—in full bloom and an emblem of resilience.
The subject matter of this piece pays tribute to the courage and strength
needed to undertake this journey, and the vital role of a community in
fostering care, belonging and mutual support.</p>
