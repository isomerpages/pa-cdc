The Community Development Councils (CDCs) were established under the [People's Association](https://www.pa.gov.sg/) Act in 1997. Since then, the CDCs have been bridging communities (i.e. by strengthening local social infrastructure, building social resilience and social capital, and promoting the culture of giving back), through the following functions:

(a) Aggregator of Needs and Resources <br>
(b) Builder of Capability / Capacity in Partners <br>
(c) Connector of Communities
