# Strategic Direction
Over the next three years, the CDCs will roll out a slew of new and ongoing common flagship programmes under the five community pillars - caring, inclusive, healthy, learning and sustainable communities - as part of this new strategic direction. These community pillars, aligning with ForwardSG, underscores CDCâ€™s efforts to adapt to increasingly complex needs in the community amidst a changing social landscape post-COVID.
