### Join Us as a CDC Volunteer!

We believe that every effort counts. Everyone has an important role to play in the community. We welcome volunteers of all ages and interests. There are so many areas you can contribute to such as caring for the vulnerable, caring for the elderly, caring for the environment and caring for community health.

For volunteer opportunities, please enter your postal code at [gowhere.gov.sg/cdc](https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/cdc) to check your district, and contact the [respective CDC](https://www.cdc.gov.sg/who-we-are/five-districts/).


Together, let’s make meaningful differences to the community today!
