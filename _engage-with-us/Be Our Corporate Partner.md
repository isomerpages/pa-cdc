One of the key roles of the CDCs is to connect the community in order to create a more cohesive and self-reliant society. The CDCs adopt the “many helping hands” approach by facilitating meaningful community collaborations among corporate companies, Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and interested individuals. The CDCs also help by identifying the needs of the vulnerable in our community and proactively matching them with the objectives and resources of community partners.

Today, many successful and ongoing community programmes are supported by our corporate partners.

Contact your nearest CDC to explore Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Projects.
For Corporate Organisations who are interested to partner the five CDCs in their CSR efforts, please email us at cpd_csr@pa.gov.sg.
