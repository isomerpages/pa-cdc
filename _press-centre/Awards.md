Title: $130 Million CDC Vouchers Scheme  
One Public Service Award

**PA/CDCs, GovTech, IMDA, ESG, MOF, SLA, MCI, SPF, ICA and DOS**

The CDC Vouchers Scheme in digital form was first launched in December 2021. It was led by the People’s Association (PA) / Community Development Councils (CDC) in close collaboration with 9 Government Agencies (GovTech, IMDA, ESG, MOF, SLA, MCI, SPF, ICA and DOS).  The second tranche of the CDC Vouchers Scheme 2022 was launched in May this year by DPM Lawrence Wong.

The 10 agencies share a common agenda, i.e. to thank Singaporeans for their solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic and to support local heartland businesses.  The WOG effort was organised into five workstreams: Policy (PA/MOF), Product (GovTech/PA), Merchants (IMDA/ESG/PA/CDCs), Grassroots (PA/CDCs), and Communication (PA/CDCs). Each agency offered its own knowledge and expertise in a mutually reinforcing way, but always in continuous conversation.  Through this process, it was able to develop a seamless digital experience for both residents and merchants.

Within a few hours of the launch in December 2021, over 200,000 households claimed their vouchers; and in less than a month, over 1 million households claimed their vouchers with over 90% of participating merchants receiving CDC Vouchers transactions.

The shift from paper to digital vouchers took more than a year to realise. The WOG team adopted a resident/merchant-centric approach to implement a nationwide digital solution which was inclusive and accessible to residents and merchants across ages and digital literacy levels, and a targeted approach to support and uplift local heartland businesses. The PA and its strong community of partners will continue to improve future iterations of this Scheme to serve our community better.

**North West District Conferred ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable Cities (ESC) Award 2017 in Brunei Darussalam**  
To stimulate, benchmark, and recognize exemplary efforts on environmental sustainability, ASEAN initiated the ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable Cities (ESC) Award programme in 2008. In its fourth edition running, the ASEAN ESC Award serves to recognise ten ASEAN cities/townships/districts that had implemented exemplary initiatives towards environmental sustainability and keeping the cities clean, green, and liveable. With the collective support of corporate, community and school partners, green volunteers and residents, the North West District has been awarded the title "ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City", for a second time, by the ASEAN National Committee at ASEAN ESC Award 2017 held on 12 September 2017 in Brunei Darussalam.  
  
> Going green is about taking ownership of the environment; being considerate to others; and ensuring a liveable Singapore. Through Green Living @ North West, I am honoured to play an active role in championing sustainability as a way of life, and inspiring more stakeholders to join our journey in realising a greener and more gracious North West District.<br>
